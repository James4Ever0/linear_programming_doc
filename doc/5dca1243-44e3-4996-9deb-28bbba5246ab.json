Updates task configuration, sets worker concurrency limit to 1, limits maximum memory per child process, and ensures code is run using celery command line.

It prints the calculated result after sleeping for 10 seconds, then serializes and deserializes the result using Pydantic data models. The code also imports various libraries for locks and handles JSON serialization/deserialization. However, the chosen locking mechanism is not effective, and there are concerns about nested data model handling and potential issues with sharing the lock.",
