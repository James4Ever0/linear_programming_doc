    "summary": "This code defines a class called \"Value\" that takes a solution object as input. It has a method \"value()\" which returns the value of a variable based on its type, supporting various data types including integers, floats, lists of variables, and numpy arrays. It handles different types of variables and ensures proper handling of solution values.",
