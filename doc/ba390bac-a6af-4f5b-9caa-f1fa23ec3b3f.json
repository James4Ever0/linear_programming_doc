    "summary": "This code imports necessary functions from two different modules, \"log_utils\" and \"ies_optim_legacy\". The \"logger_print\" function is imported to handle logging operations while the \"*\" symbol after \"ies_optim_legacy\" imports all functions present in that module. This suggests that these functions will be used for optimization tasks related to IES (Intelligent Energy Systems).",
